### CSS Layout:

1. **Utilize CSS Grid for Product Layouts:**
   - Consider using CSS Grid for organizing and styling your product layouts.
   - It provides a clean and efficient way to structure your content.

3. **Image Styling for Cohesive Design:**
   - Maintain consistent image ratios to prevent layout inconsistencies.
   - This creates a visually pleasing and cohesive design.

4. **Set Desktop Max Width: "1440px"**
   - Apply a maximum width to your site on desktop to improve readability.
   - This maintains a visually appealing design.

5. **Use Grid Gutter/Gap for Spacing:**
   - Opt for grid gutter/gap to create spacing between elements.
   - This is preferred over relying on margins for a more consistent and controlled layout.

### CSS Styling "Best Practices":

1. **Implement CSS Reset:**
   - Include a CSS reset to ensure a consistent baseline for styles across different browsers.

2. **Prioritize Index.html as Home Page:**
   - Rename your homepage file to `index.html` for clarity and convention.

3. **Typography for Readability:**
   - Choose a sans-serif font for body copy to enhance readability.

4. **Scroll Bars:**
   - Consider removing scroll bars for the terms of service and privacy policy pages.
   - This improves navigation.

5. **Text Alignment for Cleaner Appearance:**
    - Opt for left alignment rather than justifying text.
    - This creates a cleaner and more readable appearance.

### Code Organization & Naming Conventions:

1. **Ensure Consistent File Naming:**
    - Standardize file naming conventions.
    - Ensure that `docDisplay` aligns with the overall naming structure used for other files.

2. **Componentization for Reusability:**
    - Create a component for the product submenu, similar to the main menu.
    - This enhances code organization and reusability.
    - Transform HTML blocks, especially the main menu and subnav, into Shadow DOM components.
    - This enhances modularity and maintainability.
