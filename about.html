                    UEI Systems is a member company of the UEI Group. UEI Systems was established in 1992 as a solution
                    for the engraving industry. Prior to UEI Systems, inconsistent metal, erratic chemistry and
                    additives, outdated and inefficient machinery plagued the engraving industry. UEI Group knew there
                    had to be a better way- so they started UEI Systems with a commitment to improve the processes,
                    supplies and raw materials for engraving.

                    Our products were developed for engravers by engravers. So we know they work and work well. We have
                    combined a state-of-the-art team of engineers, chemists and most importantly engravers to develop
                    our UEI Systems product line. Our team has employed proven practices in combination with new
                    innovative, sophisticated technology to produce a product line that engravers can count on. We
                    wanted our products to be reliable, environmentally sound, quality driven, timesaving, and useful.
